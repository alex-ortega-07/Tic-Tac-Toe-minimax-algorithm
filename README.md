# Tic-Tac-Toe-minimax-algorithm
A graphical Tic Tac Toe that uses the minimax algorithm. Press a number from `0` to `9` to set the level of difficulty. From level `0` to `2` the computer responds randomly. From levels `3` to `9` it uses the minimax algorithm with the depth equal to the level of difficulty.
